                <p>A summary of my engineering projects related to university coursework.</p>
                <p2>So far, I have only taken one project-based engineering course called Engineering Innovation (EGR 103). My two team projects in that class are highlighted below.
                In the future, I will be taking courses known as Transport Phenomena Laboratory, Chemical Engineering Design, Process Control Laboratory, and Unit Operations Laboratory,
                in which you can expect more projects here.

            <h1>Childproof Faucet Cover for URS of Dayton</h1>
            <h2>EGR 103 - Engineering Innovation, Professor Li Cao, Ph.D</h2>
            <h3>October 9, 2024 - November 20, 2024</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>The objective of this project was to construct a childproof gooseneck faucet cover for <a href="https://ursdayton.org" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">URS of Dayton</a>. 
            The group was limited to a $75.00 budget and a two month project deadline.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>After <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">brainstorming and innovating,</span> the team decided on producing two 3D-printed interlocking covers on the handles of the sink.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">rigorously test and improve</span> the design, a variety of qualitative pass/fail tests and computer simulated quantitative force tests were conducted.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After the first prototype <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">failed</span> to sustain significant longitudinal stress, the team <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">analyzed and evaluated</span> the points of structural weakness.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The team <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">refined and transformed</span> the previous design to strengthen the previous weak points, resulting in a successful final design.</p>

            <h1>Cardboard Furniture for Disaster Relief</h1>
            <h2>EGR 103 - Engineering Innovation, Professor Li Cao, Ph.D</h2>
            <h3>August 28, 2024 - October 2, 2024</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>The objective of this project was to utilize limited resources to construct functional cardboard furniture for disaster relief.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Several <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">harsh constraints</span> posed a challenge to our team: 
            the furniture must have a surface area of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">480</span> square inches and
            support <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">650</span> pound force, all with only 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">2640</span> square inches of cardboard available. Two attempts to achieve this were permitted.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The team's first <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">design selection</span> was two inverted cardboard triangles that slid into each other at the middle.
            While this design was <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">resource efficient</span>, it unfortunately struggled to evenly distribute the force
            and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">decisively failed</span> after only supporting <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">6 pounds!</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>The team decided to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">change design focus</span> entirely by switching to a cylindrical design known as Infinity - boasting
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">two central cylinders</span> reinforced at the base and top.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">innovative</span> new approach proved <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">successful</span> as the Infinity design supported
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">over 700 pounds</span>, meeting and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">exceeding project expectations.</span></p>
