            <h1>Dean's List and 4.0/4.0 GPA at University of Dayton</h1>
            <h2>University of Dayton - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>Fall 2024 Semester</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I recently was accepted into University of Dayton, and I enrolled for classes for the Fall 2024 semester.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That semester, I took <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">17</span> credit hours at UD, as well as an additional
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">4</span> credit hours at Sinclair Community College, for a total of 21 credit hours.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite the heavy credit hour load, I managed to achieve a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">perfect 4.0/4.0 GPA</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This accomplishment also earned me a prestigious spot on the University of Dayton <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Dean's List</span> for Fall 2024.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This did not come easy, as all 21 credit hours of courses were tough, technical courses. More specifically, I took Material & Energy Balances, Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics,
            Excel VBA Computations, Engineering Innovation, Applied Differential Equations, Physics II: Electricity & Magnetism, and Java Software Development II.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I look forward to continuing to work hard and excel in my future coursework.</p>

            <h1>Associate's Degree of Computer Science</h1>
            <h2>Sinclair Community College - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>May 2022 - December 2024</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>If you've made your way over to the About page, you'll know that before Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, I wanted to study Computer Science in university.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By the time I made the decision to switch, I had already accumulated <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">30+ credit hours</span> towards the 61 required for the program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, in 2023 and 2024, I slowly took a class here and there to work towards completing the program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On December 10, 2024, I finished the last and final project for my <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Computer Science Degree</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I obtained the degree in joint with my Mathematics degree (listed under this one). I was <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">17 years old</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I learned various <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">software languages</span>, including C/C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I still have a passion for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">producing software</span>, and in the future I plan to learn Python, C#, and more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of my coursework solutions are uploaded on a GitHub account, which you can access <a href="https://github.com/CJNesbit4" style="color: white" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h1>Associate's Degree of Mathematics</h1>
            <h2>Sinclair Community College - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>August 2021 - December 2024</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>This degree came as a pleasant surprise when browsing my programs at Sinclair College.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had recently enrolled in my last required class for my Computer Science degree, and noticed that the Mathematics program could be completed if I added it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In order to receive a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">third Associate's Degree</span>, I had to make sure all degree programs had, at minimum,
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">12 credit hours</span> difference between them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After consulting an advisor, and reviewing my elective credits, it was concluded that all of my programs were <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">14 credit hours</span> apart.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, after notifying the registrar office, it was confirmed that I had completed the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Associate of Science, Mathematics</span> degree program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The class that completed the degree also completed my Computer Science coursework at the same time. As mentioned previously, I was <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">17 years old</span>.</p>

            <h1>Associate's Degree of Chemistry achieved at 16 Years Old</h1>
            <h2>Sinclair Community College - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>August 2022 - July 2024</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>Using the power of dual enrollment and the opportunities provided by Sinclair and the College Credit Plus program, I was able to achieve an
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Associate of Science degree</span> in the discipline of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Chemistry</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The final class for the completion of the degree concluded on July 7, 2024, just two weeks before my 17th birthday.
            That meant I had obtained a college degree at <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">age 16!</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>The coursework to obtain the degree was tough and challenging, yet rewarding. Among the relevant coursework are familiar classes like
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">General & Organic Chemistry</span>, both year-long courses including lab sections, and
            difficult mathematical courses going up to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Calculus III</span>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition, the chemistry courses were transferred from <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Kettering Medical College</span>.
            I cannot gauge if this makes my straight A's in these courses more of a feat than if they were taken at Sinclair, but I have strong reason to believe it is.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Please note the coursework for this degree was completed on July 7. Due to a computer system error at Sinclair's Registrar Office,
            the degree was not marked as completed until early September, moving the degree into December 2024 graduation - at no fault of mine.

            <br><br>
            <p>I took the American Chemical Society (ACS) Finals for both General & Organic Chemistry at the end of the respective courses.</p>
