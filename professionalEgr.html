            <h2>Marathon Petroleum, Robinson IL Refinery</h2>
            <h3>Spring 2026</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I've accepted a co-op offer from <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Marathon Petroleum Corporation</span> for the Spring 2026 semester!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to join the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">largest petroleum refiner in the United States!</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>I've had the opportunity to connect with over <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">130 engineers</span> with Marathon before starting my position.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Out of those, I've personally had phone calls with around 40 of them discussing their career at Marathon.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These informative 'interviews' were what convinced me to apply to Marathon in the first place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to John Beck, Abigail Coffin, and Seth Barefoot for helping me prepare my resume, cover letter, and for the interviewing process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to Marathon engineers Zach Heck, Sarah Caldbeck, Michael Torrez, John Kasiborski, Caleb Neufeld, and Brad Martin for helping me throughout the referral process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to Kaitlin Peraino, Taylor Thorpe, and Brendan Moorehead for an awesome interviewing process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to John Swearingen for your continuing mentorship in my professional and personal life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to Tom Minor, Loren Barnhurst, Bob Chaney, Tony Saliba, Michael Elsass, and Kevin Myers for their academic support leading up to this point.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Special Thanks to my parents for their love and support throughout the last few insane months and the ups and downs in this journey.</p>

            <h1>Chemical Process Intern</h1>
            <h2>University of Dayton Research Institute, Curran Place - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>January 2025 - present</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I have recently started working in the Power & Energy division at the University of Dayton Research Institute, with the Aerospace Product Support & Applied Digital Systems group.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I have not yet had to opportunity to contribute to as many projects as I have at Fuels & Combustion, I can tell you what to expect in the future: </p>
            <br>
            <p>I will be contributing to the development of a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">mobile petroleum desulfurization unit</span> to convert high sulfur jet fuels into low sulfur diesel fuels.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I will be gaining experience by helping contribute to the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">design of extraction towers, catalytic reaction design, recycle processes, process flow diagrams, and more!</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>For the rest of the Spring semester (present - May), the unit will be designed and parts will be ordered. Only theoretical design and project development will happen during this time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My internship is continuing through the Summer, when the unit will be constructed and the actual <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">chemical processes</span> I'll help design can be tested!</p>
            <br>
            <p>So far I've developed the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">technical data package</span> draft for the unitâ€™s design. The technical data package contains information about <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">manufacturing processes, chemical processes, and safety requirements</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Pictured next to me is the previous design of the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">extraction towers</span> that extract the sulfur from the jet fuels.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This section of my work experience will be dynamically updated as I learn new things and accomplish project goals, so stay tuned.</p>

            <h1>Fuel Science Intern</h1>
            <h2>University of Dayton Research Institute, Shroyer Park Center - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>October 2024 - present</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I have obtained great amounts of industry <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">knowledge and experience</span> throughout my ongoing internship with the Fuels & Energetic Materials division of the University of Dayton Research Institute.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have had the privilege and opportunity to contribute to many research projects regarding aviation turbine fuels (jet fuels).</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have analyzed gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and relative permittivity data of over <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">70+</span> international jet fuels to correlate and model various fuel properties, in some cases reviewing and correcting data to increase accuracy of analysis by up to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">30%</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In one project, I used advanced simulated distillation software to generate over <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">100</span> distillation points for each jet fuel. To verify the quality and accuracy of these points, multiple software packages were used to adhere to interlab study reproducibility standards.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For another project, I tested the effects on dielectric constant of various fuel additives such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_system_icing_inhibitor" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">FSII</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_inhibitor" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">CI/LI</a>,
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antistatic_agent#Fuels" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">SDA</a>.
            The dielectric constant is likely used on modern aircraft to perform onboard fuel gauging.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The findings were quite revolutionary, and I'll be proudly presenting them at the University of Dayton's <a href="https://udayton.edu/provost/stander/index.php" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">Stander Symposium</a> this coming spring. After the symposium, the presentation will be available under the <a href="other.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: none;">Other</a> page of this website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I collaborated with <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">small teams</span> of around <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">4 - 7</span> other research professionals to deliver accurate results, meeting and exceeding project deadlines.</p>
