            <h3>January 2026 - May 2026</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I accepted a co-op offer from <a href="https://www.marathonpetroleum.com" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank"><span style="color: #db0632">Marathon</span> <span style="color: white">Petroleum</span> <span style="color: #0033a0">Corporation</span></a> for the Spring 2026 semester!
                I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to join the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">largest petroleum refiner in the United States!</p>
            <br>

            <h1>Fuel Science Intern II</h1>
            <h2>University of Dayton Research Institute, Shroyer Park Center - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>August 2025 - December 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I resumed my work with the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Fuel Science</span> group in Fall 2025 during my ongoing internship with the Fuels & Energetic Materials division of the University of Dayton Research Institute.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This term, I continued research on the dielectric properties of jet fuel, but also got to dive into the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">Surface Tension</a> measurements.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I performed around <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">50+</span> surface tension experiments using pure components of standard jet fuels to commission our group's new instrument. I used around <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">5</span> different needle diameters, as well as variying temperature and air flow rates to observe trends.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also continued working on the dielectric research, this time searching for a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">blending rule</span> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_system_icing_inhibitor" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">FSII</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was accomplished by <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">mixing controlled amounts</span> of additive into a pure bulk composition with a known dielectric constant and observing the upshift caused by the additive.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A blending rule was developed, and an academic publication is in the works. When it is finished it will be available under the <a href="research.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: none;">Research</a> page of this website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Contingent on funding I will be <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">returning to Fuel Science</span> at UDRI for Fall 2026 and Spring 2027 part-time.

            <h1>Chemical Process Co-op</h1>
            <h2>University of Dayton Research Institute, Curran Place - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>January 2025 - August 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I co-oped with the Power & Energy Division at University of Dayton Research Institute, assisting with the development of a fuel desulfurization unit for the United States Air Force.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I gained valuable <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">hands-on experience</span> with both the design and construction of various refining process units!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was able to observe and contribute first-hand to the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">design of extraction towers, catalytic reaction design, recycle processes, process flow diagrams, and more!</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>During the Spring semester, I worked part-time. I familiarized myself with the unit and its design, and contributed to digital sides of the effort.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the Summer semester, I worked full-time. I was able to gain experience with <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">process simulators</span> with Aspen!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had the privilege to gain experience reading and developing <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">process flow diagrams (PFDs), piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), and controls diagrams.</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>Pictured next to me is the previous design of the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">extraction towers</span> that extract the sulfur from the jet fuels.</p>

            <h1>Fuel Science Intern I</h1>
            <h2>University of Dayton Research Institute, Shroyer Park Center - Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>October 2024 - May 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I have obtained great amounts of industry <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">knowledge and experience</span> throughout my ongoing internship with the Fuels & Energetic Materials division of the University of Dayton Research Institute.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have had the privilege and opportunity to contribute to many research projects regarding aviation turbine fuels (jet fuels).</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have analyzed gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and relative permittivity data of over <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">70+</span> international jet fuels to correlate and model various fuel properties, in some cases reviewing and correcting data to increase accuracy of analysis by up to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">30%</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In one project, I used advanced simulated distillation software to generate over <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">100</span> distillation points for each jet fuel. To verify the quality and accuracy of these points, multiple software packages were used to adhere to interlab study reproducibility standards.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For another project, I tested the effects on dielectric constant of various fuel additives such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_system_icing_inhibitor" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">FSII</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_inhibitor" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">CI/LI</a>,
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antistatic_agent#Fuels" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #888;" target="_blank">SDA</a>.
            The dielectric constant is likely used on modern aircraft to perform onboard fuel gauging.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The findings were quite revolutionary, and they are available under the <a href="research.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: none;">Research</a> page of this website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My project on additives, as well as future work with the effects of water solubility, was recently sponsored by <a href="https://nasa.gov" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0032A0;" target="_blank">NASA</a> via the Ohio Space Grant Consortium.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I collaborated with <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">small teams</span> of around <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">4 - 7</span> other research professionals to deliver accurate results, meeting and exceeding project deadlines.</p>
