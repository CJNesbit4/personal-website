                <h2>CME CASH</h2>
                <p>Ok, let me explain what this page is, assuming you have no idea what CME even is.</p>
                <p2>CME stands for Chemical and Materials Engineering, specifically that department at University of Dayton.</p2>
                <br><br>
                <p2>The undergraduate program director essentially told me that no student had ever given him $100 in cash as a joke. My first idea was Monopoly money, and then I realized I could do better with Photoshop. So I photoshopped a $100 bill with his face, and other details.</p2>
                <br><br>
                <p2>It was a huge hit among my classmates, professors, and staff. So, I did it with the department chair too! I'll keep going with whoever won't get too mad at me, and if I have time.</p2>
                <br><br>
                <p2><span style="font-size: 20px; color: red">IMPORTANT:</span> There are two types of printable cash here. One is a double sided PDF that you can print with the "double-sided" option on both printers. Unfortunately, this factors in a 0.01" offset error.
                I print mine one side at a time using the "front" and "back" pdfs. Make sure you know what orientation to reload the paper in the tray before doing this though!</p2>

            <h1>Krupa Kash - $1 Edition</h1>
            <h2>Currently Printable</h2>
            <h3>Debuted April 23, 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>Krupa Kash is the second CME currency made.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I put significantly more effort into the production of Krupa Kash, including photoshopping the seals, signatures, and background patterns.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Krupa Kash will be like US dollars - constantly printed with nothing backing their value, yet somehow retaining their status as a currency.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>To print the double-sided version, <a href="files/Krupa Kash - Full.pdf" style="color:white" target="_blank">Click Here</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For the separated sides, access the front <a href="files/Krupa Kash - Front.pdf" style="color:white" target="_blank">here</a> and the back <a href="files/Krupa Kash - Back.pdf" style="color:white" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Make sure you know how to orient the paper when you reload the tray to prevent printing errors!</p>

            <h1>Elsass Bucks</h1>
            <h2>Only available in $100 - NOT CURRENTLY PRINTABLE</h2>
            <h3>Debuted April 15, 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>Elsass Bucks were the original CME currency.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They are like Bitcoin, I will likely not be printing anymore so they are not available to print here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Twelve were originally printed. As far as I am aware, they are in the hands of Anna, Audrey, me, Dr. Myers, Dr. Ciric, Dr. Elsass, Alan, Carson, Lindsey, Taylor, Dr. Krupa, and one was lost.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would find it very funny if one or two are still around sometime in like 2030.</p>
