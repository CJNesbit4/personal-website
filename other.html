            <h2>Dayton, OH</h2>
            <h3>April 19, 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I recently made the local news - The Dayton Daily News!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was featured in <a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/sinclair-has-record-amount-graduate-with-degrees-from-college-credit-plus-program/XA2IBLZDTNE2HCJQHFTDCOY65Q/" style="font-weight: bold; color: white" target="_blank">this article</a> 
            for being the first Sinclair <a href="https://www.sinclair.edu/academics/ccp/" style="font-weight: bold; color: white" target="_blank">College Credit Plus</a> student to graduate with not one, not two, but <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">three Associate Degrees</span> before graduating high school!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I earned <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">76 college credits for free at Sinclair</span> from Fall 2021 to Fall 2024, as well as <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">23</span> from Kettering College. In Fall 2024, I transferred my credits to 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">University of Dayton</span> to begin studying <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Chemical Engineering</span>. So far, I've earned <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">35</span> credits from University of Dayton,
            totalling <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">134 college credits</span> in the time I should have been in High School (Aug 2021-May 2025).</p>
            <br>
            <p>My College Credit Plus experience has been nothing short of phenomenal. I'm grateful for the program and all the experiences it has given me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would highly recommend Dual Enrollment for any motivated high school students looking to gain an advantage, in both time and money, before entering college.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had the opportunity to study and receive my degrees in the fields of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Chemistry, Computer Science, and Mathematics</span>, all of which have added valuable skills to my Chemical Engineering career.</p></div>

            <h1>Sinclair Summer STEM Program - Robot Math Lab - GORT</h1>
            <h2>Sinclair Community College</h2>
            <h3>June 2024</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>In the Math/Robotics Lab section of the Sinclair Summer STEM Program, my team programmed this!</p>
            <br>
            <p>The robot's name is Gort. It was named that randomly before our group received him. We still do not know the original name,
            but we 'renamed' him to G.O.R.T - <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">Greatest Of Robot Time!</span>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This robot was custom made by professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-chaney-47779b16/" style="font-weight: bold; color: white;" target="_blank">Bob Chaney</a>. I had him for Calculus III!</p>
            <br>
            <p>As you can see, the marker that the robot uses to draw its name is in the center. This is not normally the case. Usually, the marker is off to the side of the robot.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The area that the marker inhabits is normally meant for the electronics, so that the robot has a stable center of mass.
            However, Dr. Chaney found a way to balance the electronics so that the robot still operated normally.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is a big deal because it allows the robot to easily and intuitively trace letters. Rotations cause the side markers to trace odd paths, and this fixes that problem.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We also made other designs, such as adding a servomotor to add and remove the marker from the table. We eventually traced the Sinclair College logo as well, though this was not recorded on video.</p>
