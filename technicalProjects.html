            <h1>This Personal Website</h1>
            <h2>Skills: HTML, CSS, Website Development, Web Design</h2>
            <h3>Created January 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>This website counts as a technical project!</p>
            <br>
            <p>This website is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">100% hand-coded</span> with no website builders used at all. Just pure HTML & CSS magic.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had a blast making this. The style and design you see is my normal go-to CSS template for all websites that I prototype.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you're reading this, that means the website is public, which means the source code is as well! Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/CJNesbit4/personal-website" style="font-weight: bold; color: white" target="_blank">GitHub here</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The best part about learning how to code is that there is no limit to what you can create. Calculators, games, apps, websites, data crunchers, etc.</p>

            <h1>Chazzy's Kitchen & Catering Website</h1>
            <h2>Skills: HTML, CSS, WordPress Hosting, WooCommerce</h2>
            <h3>Late July 2024 - March 2025</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>Note as of March 2025 - The owner of Chazzy's Kitchen passed away in March of 2025. The project is unfortunately terminated.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've also created a website for a local Dayton business known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chazzyskitchen/" style="font-weight: bold; color: white" target="_blank">Chazzy's Kitchen</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can see a preview of the general layout and design in the image box.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, this was my first time creating a website for a restaurant business and it's been a valuable experience.</p>

            <h1>Chrome Extension Development</h1>
            <h2>Skills: JavaScript, Manifest v3</h2>
            <h3>June 2023 - present</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>I also develop personal unpacked extensions to get rid of inconveniences in my life as an engineering student and developer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of these extensions are still private or shared within my circle, and I am not interested in publishing them to the Chrome store.
            If any of these pique your interest, reach out to me and I can provide you the unpacked versions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've developed extensions to easily <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">copy greek symbols to the clipboard</span>, instead of having to google them or look up the alt code.
            I'm hoping to eventually add more symbols and a searching system before publicly publishing this one.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've made a variety of extensions that <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">modify the Chrome theme</span> and add sounds for typing, closing and opening tabs, and other effects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I created an extension that simply <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">reproduces the random number generator</span> found from googling 'rng' in your search bar.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, I'm currently developing an extension that can <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">interpret chemical compounds</span> (ex. CO2) and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">report the molecular weight data.</span>
            I have currently functional code written in C++ from 2023 that I'm converting into JavaScript, but it's a pretty low priority right now.

            <h1>YouTube Channel Producer</h1>
            <h2>Skills: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <h3>September 2020 - August 2024</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>In the past I would upload clips of video games of my friends and I.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I discovered I love producing and editing videos and their respective thumbnails.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I started making and editing real effort and quality videos starting in 2022.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I learned how to use <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Adobe Premiere Pro</span> to professionally edit videos and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">Adobe Photoshop</span> to produce high quality thumbnails.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I slowed down in 2024 to focus more on university and the other things you find on this website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I uploaded very few videos in 2024, and published my last video in August 2024.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my total time, I had created a channel that accumulated over <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">1,000,000</span> views, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">7,000,000</span> impressions, 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">50,000</span> watch time hours, and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white">4,000 subscribers.</span></p>
