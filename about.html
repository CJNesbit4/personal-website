            <h1>Hi, I'm CJ Nesbit.</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>I am a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">17</span> year old university student from Dayton, Ohio.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As of August 2024, I have been studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Dayton. Currently, I am expected to graduate in December 2026.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have Associate of Science degrees in the disciplines of Chemistry, Computer Science, and Mathematics.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am exceptionally skilled in data analysis, computer programming, process improvement, and problem solving.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have a passion for using my skills to improve, develop, optimize, and advance the energy systems of the modern world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I possess both professional and academic engineering experience, with a proven record of outstanding success and team collaboration that drives results.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My university and self-improvement journey started in the fall of 2021, when I was 14. Since then, I've learned various invaluable lessons and gained priceless experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy chess, software development, and working out. I also frequently read textbooks and watch educational content on YouTube, usually physics content.</p>

            <h1>High School, Freshman Year</h1>
            <h2>August 2021 - May 2022</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>My freshman year of high school was August 2021 - May 2022.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At the time I was a hybrid homeschool student at Dayton Christian High School. I took band, history, and high school chemistry there.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I qualified for the <a href="https://sinclair.edu/academics/ccp/" style="color: #888;" target="_blank">College Credit Plus</a> program in Ohio, and took Precalculus and English Composition 1 through <a href="https://www.sinclair.edu/" style="color: #888;" target="_blank">Sinclair Community College</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I previously enjoyed basic block coding in Scratch and creating mathematical calculators in simple languages. I wanted to study computer science at the time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, under the amazing mentorship of my chemistry professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-minor-310248113" style="color: #888;" target="_blank">Tom Minor sir</a>, I excelled and loved chemistry, a subject I believed I would struggle with and strongly dislike.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this time, an old friend of mine reintroduced me to chess, a hobby I would stick with to this day. More on that later, though.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the spring semester, I took Calculus 1 and barely clinched an A in the course. I also took English Composition 2, both through Sinclair. After getting an A in Calculus 1 at just 14 years old, I started to realize that I could go far if I really applied myself in full.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Seeing the opportunities ahead of me, I turned on the jets and went all in on Dual Enrollment and College Credit Plus for the remaining of my high school education.</p>

            <h1>Sophomore Year and the Change</h1>
            <h2>June 2022 - May 2023</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Over the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, I took one class; an introductory C++ problem solving class.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had a blast with it, and wanted to continue along the Sinclair Computer Science program. I took another C++ software development course that fall.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, after my outstanding high school chemistry experience, I also wanted to continue that, and so I took General Chemistry 1 at Kettering Medical College as well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also took a Communications course, and enrolled in Calculus II, which I ended up dropping after a bad start with the first exam and online office hour compatibility.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My college chemistry professor was phenomenal, and simply the best. <a href="https://kc.edu/?staff=loren-barnhurst" style="color: #888;" target="_blank">Dr. Loren Barnhurst sir</a> developed my chemistry knowledge, my wisdom, my maturity, my potential, and much more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe that I have flourished in chemistry as much as I have because of the divinely amazing professors I've had placed in my life. Without them, none of this would be reality.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In spring semester, I took C++ Data Structures & Algorithms as well as retaking Calculus II through Sinclair. I took General Psychology and General Chemistry II at Kettering.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also scored a 99th percentile on the ACS General Chemistry Final, indicating that perhaps I should continue with my chemistry studies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Around this time, AI started to take off, and I reflected on the fact that I had multiple online Computer Science university friends, yet none of them had obtained steady careers, and only one had obtained an internship.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In light of this fact, I switched directions and changed my major to Chemistry.</p>

            <h1>Junior Year and Chemical Engineering</h1>
            <h2>June 2023 - May 2024</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>In the fall semester, I took Calculus III and a software applications class for my degrees from Sinclair. To this day, Calculus III remains one of my favorite courses.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I took Organic Chemistry 1 and Introductory Biology from Kettering College. Organic Chemistry also quickly began one of my favorite courses to this day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At the time, I had zero idea what Chemical Engineering was, but after my father brought it up as a possibility, I started strongly considering it. It seemed to combine my talents of chemistry, computer science, and mathematics. In addition, the job statistics and salary were much more promising than chemistry or computer science.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the spring semester, I took Physics 1 (Mechanics) and three general education courses from Sinclair, as well as Organic Chemistry II from Kettering.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In nothing short of a miracle, it just so happened that my sister's friend's (uncle? cousin twice removed?) something was the graduate program director of Chemical Engineering at University of Dayton. I wanted to learn more about Chemical Engineering, so I sent him an e-mail.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What I was not expecting was a personal invitation to meet with <a href="https://www.aiche.org/community/bio/kevin-j-myers" style="color: #888;" target="_blank">Dr. Kevin Myers sir</a> for the afternoon to talk about Chemical Engineering and tour the laboratories at UD.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This kind gesture, coupled with what I took away from our meeting, convinced me that I should become a Chemical Engineer!</p>

            <h1>Senior Year and beyond...</h1>
            <h2>June 2024 - present day</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>At this point, I was wrapping up my Sinclair associate degree programs, getting ready to transfer to University of Dayton, and excited for the future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In July of 2024, I finished my last class required for my A.S. Chemistry, completed on July 7, 2024, just two weeks before I would turn 17.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Just two days later, on July 9, 2024, I was accepted into the University of Dayton, with a good scholarship offer. I committed the week of.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Within the month of July, I completed all my 'homework' to transfer my 95 college credits into UD, at a 100% transfer rate. Thank you Sinclair!</p>
            <br>
            <p>On August 19, 2024, I began my first classes and 17 credits at University of Dayton. In addition, I took one final 4 credit hour class at Sinclair to wrap up my other degree programs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also began using University of Dayton's resources to find internship opportunities. Through the power of networking, referrals, and interviews, I was able to obtain two internship offers in October.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Both were with the University of Dayton Research Institute, the professional research arm of the university. I began my first internship working in Fuel Science in late October. The experience has been amazing, but I also have to mention how lucky I am to have such amazing coworkers and supervisors.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My other offer started in 2025, as an Aerospace Product Support Engineering intern. We'll see what experience and places that internship takes me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, I'm looking at the future with confidence. I can't wait for more opportunities to learn, improve, and grow, both professionally and personally.</p>

            <h1>Chess</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Chess is my largest non-professional related pastime, so it deserves its own section here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Chess has had immense positive benefits on my life throughout my journey, and I'm an advocate for everyone to at least learn and try it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Countless studies have proven that it improves critical thinking, patience, logic under pressure, memory, self-control, neuroplasticity, and intelligence overall.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I'm still an intermediate level player, I always enjoy a good game with a friend.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition, instead of watching sportsball games, you'll likely find me watching the current top chess tournaments and players.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My favorite players of all time are Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Alireza Firouzja, and of course Levy Rozman. Even over the 64 squares, they are an inspiration in my life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Too many people, including my past self, are too scared to approach chess out of fear of failure, looking 'stupid', or thinking they won't ever 'get it'.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you're one of those people, I encourage you to try new things, to take risks, and most importantly, learn! All progress comes from learning. So try chess. You just might like it.</p>
